      <br><br>
      Since graduating in 2018, I've written an average of 43 words/day in my iPhone's notes app. That number grew to 67 words/day in the last year.
      My top 3 most frequently used words from those notes should say a lot about me. They are: <span class="top3">feel</span>, <span class="top3">people</span>, and <span class="top3">time</span> (not including <a href="https://gist.github.com/larsyencken/1440509">stop words</a>).
      <br><br>
      I <span class="top3">feel</span> strongly about personal tech (primarily wearables), and autonomy. Novel applications of AI/ML also pique my interest.
      <br><br>
      The <span class="top3">people</span> in my life inspire me and help me see clearly. I love hearing the perspectives of my friends, meeting new people, and spending quality time others. My high school yearbook <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/218410-there-isn-t-anyone-you-couldn-t-love-once-you-ve-heard-their">quote</a> was: "There isn't anyone you couldn't love once you've heard their story."
      Lol. For better or for worse, this still resonates with me.
      <br><br>
      In my spare <span class="top3">time,</span> you can find me walking or running through San Francisco's parks, writing (often an elaboration of notes), traveling (down the street counts, within my apartment doesn't), and singing quietly enough
      that I don't attract the attention of my neighbors (usually a failure).
      <br><br>
      "Amazon" is #9 on my list of most frequently used words in my notes app. It's also where I currently work. I'm a Product Manager on a Zero-to-One incubator team that develops solutions that to large-scale problems inside and outside Amazon's existing businesses.
