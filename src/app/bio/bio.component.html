      I was raised in Lexington, MA, where I spent time building things and making friends.
      Being the town geek led me to start a business building computers and fixing software problems for my friends and their families.
      It was called jComp.

      I took a particular interest in robotics as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUFBFjpnXDs">kid</a>.
      There was a magic to robots, and I beleived their existence would improve people's lives.

          My focuses are in consumer technology, autonomous robotics, and AI. I pivoted from software engineer to Product Manager  work at Amazon as a Product Manager on a Zero-to-One incubator team, developing solutions to problems in and outside of Amazon's existing businesses.
          I write 60 words/day in my iPhone's Notes app, on average. My top 3 most frequently used words are: feel, people, and time (not including <a href="https://gist.github.com/larsyencken/1440509">stop words</a>).

          I've been living and working in San Francisco since 2018. These are some <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eQW8go82BZefkm6f72pNYoKJy0OAVe2MKDWGMTjPP5o/edit">recs</a> I give me friends when they visit.
