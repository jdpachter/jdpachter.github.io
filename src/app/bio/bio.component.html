      I was raised in Lexington, MA, where I spent time building things and making friends.

          I still love robotics and get to work with them in my day-to-day job. My current focuses are in consumer technology, autonomous robotics, and AI. I pivoted from software engineer to Product Manager  work at Amazon as a Product Manager on a Zero-to-One incubator team, developing solutions to problems in and outside of Amazon's existing businesses.
