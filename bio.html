                Growing up, I was the geeky kid who could fix your computer.  At 10, I started a business building computers and fixing software problems for my friends and their families.
                It was called jComp. I still get occasional calls from people I don't know asking for computer help.

                I loved robotics from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUFBFjpnXDs" target="_blank">young age</a>, and competed on a FIRST robotics team from ages 11 to 18.
                That team, <i>The Battery Powered Picklejar Heads,</i> taught me how fun it is to do what you love with people who inspire you. Turns out, we were also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR-SuCxWwMM" target="_blank">really good robot builders</a>!
                We competed internationally three times. In 2013, I got to show Dean Kamen around our robot. Nine years later, I caught up with him at a work event and got him to sign one of my robotics team shirts.

                After studying Computer Science and Philosophy at the University of Rochester, I moved to San Francisco. I started a job as a software engineer at Amazon, working
                on Alexa speech ML systems, then later a new physical stores project which eventually became Amazon Style.

                At work, I would constantly find myself in spaces where I was the only engineer, which I loved. The decisions we made in those spaces were usually more
                meaningful than the decisions we made in spaces with only engineers. I practiced telling stories of our product, why it mattered, and what using it looks like, to all sorts of different people.
                I formally switched roles to Product Manager 3 years in.

                Today, I work on a Zero-to-One innovation group at Amazon. We develop solutions for large-scale problems in our business. Within that group, I lead a wearable biomechanics
                project. We're building a platform to improve worker safety by using individual movement data to power personalized adjustments in Amazon's robotics fulfillment centers.

                I'm most interested in personal technology, autonomous robotics, and AI. I've been living and working in San Francisco since 2018. These are some <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eQW8go82BZefkm6f72pNYoKJy0OAVe2MKDWGMTjPP5o/edit" target="_blank">recommendations</a> I give my friends when they visit.
