            I’m a Product Manager working on a wearable biomechanics platform at Amazon. Before this, I developed software for an Alexa ML team, and Amazon Style.

            I grew up outside Boston, and studied computer Science and philosophy at the University of Rochester. My computer science background is in back-end development, and my main philosophical interests are ethics and philosophy of mind.
